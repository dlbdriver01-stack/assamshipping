INSTRUCTIONS — safely add Firebase credentials

1) Local dev with a service account file:
   - Download service account JSON from Firebase Console (Project Settings -> Service accounts).
   - Save the file as `serviceAccountKey.json` in the project root (do NOT commit this file).
   - Run the seed script:
       npm install
       npx ts-node scripts/seed-firestore.ts

2) Using environment variable (CI or local):
   - Set the environment variable FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY to the entire JSON content (escaped).
   - Example (Linux/macOS):
       export FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY="$(cat ~/Downloads/serviceAccountKey.json)"
   - Then run the seed script.

3) Web SDK keys:
   - Put your web SDK keys into `config/.env.local` using the `.env.example` as a template.
   - These keys are considered less sensitive but still should be protected in public repos.

4) Do NOT paste private_key or service account JSON into public places. Rotate keys if they were exposed.

5) If your service account was exposed previously, revoke and create a new one in Firebase Console immediately.
